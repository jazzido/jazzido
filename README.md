I'm a software engineer with more than 20 years of industry experience. 

I also play instruments, and sometimes I make videos that I post to [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/aristamanu/) and [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/user/jazzido). 

My open source projects are hosted in my [GitHub profile](https://github.com/jazzido). 

Ocasionally I drop by [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/users/3302955/manuel-aristar%c3%a1n) to answer questions about [Tabula](https://github.com/tabulapdf/tabula), a PDF scraper which I created in 2013 and continue to maintain. I got my master's degree at the [MIT Media Laboratory](https://media.mit.edu). If you're still curious about me, take a look at my [LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/maristaran/). If you need to contact me, email me at [hola@manu.ar](mailto:hola@manu.ar).
